# Nostr Client 

I'm playing around with Nostr's decentralised social media protocol. 

![Nostr logo](/src/nostr.jpg)

It's **"a simple, open protocol that enables a truly censorship-resistant and global social network"**, with multiple relays that users can subscribe to with a simple public/private key combination in lieu of other more personal (read: identifying) credentials. 

It launched late last year, although has been in development for significantly longer, and is already rallying a hugely dynamic ecosystem.

So I'm building out a simple client to play around with the different relays and event types - for the moment, it's just subscribing to long-form text events. And I'll just be tooling around to see how I can link up simple funcitonalities like corralling all comments under the correct posts, and getting a slick design in place.

See the live and VERY early MVP [here](https://nostrami.netlify.app/) - I've throttled the content coming through to calm down the feed a little, and am currently subscribed only to the relatively spam-free relay.nostr.band/trusted whilst I'm testing out things like filters and features. 

## Next Steps

I'm going to play around building out features like: 
- searching for content from specific users, 
- Posting content to the relay,
- encrypted messaging.
